In this blog post, we are going to talk about another category of code smells localized at the method level.

# Method Signature

Before listing the code smells related to a method, let's first understand what do we mean by a method signature.

> Methods are declared in a class, struct, or interface by specifying the access level such as public or private, optional modifiers such as abstract or sealed, the return value, the name of the method, and any method parameters. These parts together are the signature of the method.
